Optimizing GPU Utilization with Time-Slicing on EKS

Key Features:
•	GPU Slicing Technique: This design uses time-slicing to allow multiple pods to share a single GPU. Time-slicing allocates GPU resources in time intervals, enabling multiple workloads to run on the same GPU without requiring exclusive access.
•	Target Workloads: Suitable for workloads that do not require exclusive access to an entire GPU and can tolerate sharing GPU resources over time.
•	Cost Efficiency: Reduces costs by maximizing GPU utilization through time-sharing.
•	Resource Utilization: Improves GPU utilization by allowing multiple pods to share a single GPU.
•	Scalability: Scales workloads by efficiently sharing GPU resources among multiple pods.

Implementation Steps:
1.	Deploy NVIDIA Device Plugin with Time-Slicing: Use Helm to deploy the NVIDIA device plugin with time-slicing enabled.
2.	Configure Pods to Use Shared GPUs: Specify GPU resource requests in pod specifications to schedule pods on nodes with shared GPU resources.
3.	Integrate with Karpenter Autoscaler: Configure Karpenter to provision GPU-enabled nodes and manage GPU resource allocation.
Note: The above is a more high level steps, I have attached a more technical document to implement the design.

Benefits of the design:
1.	GPU Slicing Technique: Uses time-slicing to allow multiple pods to share a single GPU by allocating GPU resources in time intervals thus allowing all workloads to share the GPU resource.
2.	Target Workloads: Best for workloads that do not require exclusive access to an entire GPU and can tolerate sharing GPU resources over time.
3.	Implementation Complexity: Easier to implement using Helm to deploy the NVIDIA device plugin with time-slicing enabled. Simpler setup but involves time-sharing of GPU resources.
4.	Resource Allocation: Allocates GPU resources in time intervals, which may lead to variable performance depending on the workload.
5.	Cost Efficiency: Reduces costs by maximizing GPU utilization through time-sharing, and can be used with a broader range of GPUs versions.

Conclusion:
•	The design maximizes GPU utilization and is more flexible in terms of GPU hardware requirements.
